        <p>In my works, I have been dealing with a lot of last minutes issue and request, it means that work will pop up, could be some calls, people approach me, email with urgent icon and marked as important because &ldquo;the content inside telling you need to do something about it ASAP blah blah&rdquo;, this just appear like hour before I wrapt my phone, bag, and lock my system.</p>
<p>Last week was different, none of that mentioned, <em>I come with self defence first</em> We had different mood, it was a holiday mood between the 25th and end of the year, two long weekend in row, time to clear leave, shutdown maybe, you can name it.</p>
<p>I was working on python application, and thou still far from complete, I need to get feedback on my application, as it right on track, match with the needs -<em>it should be!</em>-, the user interaction, and is this application should be dumb easy, so that I can make revision or whatever needed to make it back on tract in the way it&rsquo;s intended to be.</p>
<p>I had the idea to make an executable with py2exe and installable packace so it&rsquo;s easy to distribute, I will just sent the installer and anyone interested will.. <em>obviously</em>, double click, next, next, &hellip; they know the drill.</p>
<p>The mood, brought me back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination">procrastination</a> habbit, or in a way it was a distraction I had in hand,</p>
<ol>
<li>Somehow, i notice small thing <em>-it always started with small thing-</em> to improve and implement, and I though I can do that in, say 2 hours.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing the same packaging (executable and installer) in another small pyhton apps, it will be just 30 minutes job.</li>
</ol>
<p>From here I go with the first point, and I did it, it was according to plan, I was taking my time actually. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Move to the next one, make executable, and &hellip; surprise, it just simply fail <code>error: MSVCP90.dll: No such file or directory</code> <em>ck, typical</em></p>
<p>I fumbled on it for sometime and still couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. <strong>Why!</strong> I&rsquo;ve been doing it with other apps, and it was fine, was it because the fine working executable using Tk inter instead of my new WxPython gui library? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Too many disturbed questions in my head, anxious, and I know it will give me a hasty solution in return. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The clever solution, give up to figure it your own and just google it, and it&rsquo;s end up in py2exe tutorial, <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step52">Providing the Microsoft Visual C runtime DLL</a> <em>my my my &hellip;</em>, It become I am the guy who didn&rsquo;t Read The <em>Fine</em> Manual, I didn&rsquo;t expect this way.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>Hey, it didn&rsquo;t give me problem with my other apps.</em> And I did according to the tutorial, prove it working, and celebrate a little about it.</p>
<p>The next wiser action, pack my things and going home :), clear my mind and come with strategy, to find out more about the why, how and implement it carefully, neatly in the code. I&rsquo;m glad I did it right on the next day as it planned, just no unwanted surprise.</p>
