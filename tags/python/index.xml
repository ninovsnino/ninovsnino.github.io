      <description>Time it better Now human need to keep up with machine, let’s keep up with them then, we are talking with milliseconds and microseconds now, we will use datetime.
import datetime &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; datetime.datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 17, 20, 29, 53, 567000) uh, …, I will change it. Too much typing.
from datetime import datetime startTime = datetime.now() # do something fast! faster! elapsedTime = datetime.now() – startTime print elapsedTime.microseconds Notice on microseconds, because Pyhton give in microseconds we can simply convert it to milliseconds with * 1000</description>

      <description>How to get delta time in python? Python provide time module, as my favourite way to get delta / elapse time, of course, depends on what you need.
I usually do taking user normal actions, by getting a simple hour-minute-seconds, like time taken running scripts, batching, clicking buttons and navigate between tabs, or buttons.
import time startTime = time.time() # doing blah... blah... # whatever actions we do in here elapsedTime = time.</description>

      <description>In my works, I have been dealing with a lot of last minutes issue and request, it means that work will pop up, could be some calls, people approach me, email with urgent icon and marked as important because &amp;ldquo;the content inside telling you need to do something about it ASAP blah blah&amp;rdquo;, this just appear like hour before I wrapt my phone, bag, and lock my system.
Last week was different, none of that mentioned, I come with self defence first We had different mood, it was a holiday mood between the 25th and end of the year, two long weekend in row, time to clear leave, shutdown maybe, you can name it.</description>
