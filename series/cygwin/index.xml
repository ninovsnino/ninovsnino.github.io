      <description>Initially I was put the title as &amp;ldquo;Read/Write issue in Cygwin&amp;rdquo; but, there&amp;rsquo;s no issue on Read operation but surely it&amp;rsquo;s on the Write operation, so there we go. During Windows XP days Write operation never be a problem maybe to some extend if you tighten up the security, however now most of operating system will have stronger access to your file and asking for admin permission. It&amp;rsquo;s for our own good, so we just need to deal with it.</description>

      <description>I have been working in *nix environment for quite sometimes, most of embedded system nowadays build on top of Linux along with *nix toolset, for me it&amp;rsquo;s with BusyBox, minimal *nix stripped down toolset dubbed by the author addresses as The Swiss Army Knife for Embedded Linux, which is true in tight constraint nature in embedded &amp;ldquo;pocket&amp;rdquo; size.
We have to live in that world, a lot of limitation and we need to overcome it with right mindset.</description>
